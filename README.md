A personal project dedicated for learning and fun. Shoutout to FreeCodeCamp for providing the tutorial.

(Still in production)

The game is a simple 2D stickman with the purpose of avoiding all the enemy by simply jumping up from them. The engine used is Unity, the tutorial used is from FCC (https://youtu.be/gB1F9G0JXOo?si=hUu0Plv0Jo8u2UNv).
